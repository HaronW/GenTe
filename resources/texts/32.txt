**The scene depicts a quiet meadow with a small wooden bridge and a stream. The terrain can be divided into four parts:**
    1. **Grassy Ground**: Flat, green grass with occasional wildflowers.
    2. **Stream**: A narrow, shallow body of water with a gentle current.
    3. **Wooden Bridge**: A flat, wooden structure crossing the stream.
    4. **Distant Trees**: Tall, leafy trees on the horizon.
