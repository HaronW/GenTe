**The scene depicts a tropical island with palm trees and a sandy beach. The terrain can be divided into four parts:**
    1. **Sandy Beach**: Flat, soft sand with occasional shells.
    2. **Palm Trees**: Tall, slender trees with large, green fronds.
    3. **Lagoon**: A calm, shallow body of water near the shore.
    4. **Rocky Outcrop**: A small, jagged rock formation near the water.
