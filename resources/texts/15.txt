**The scene depicts a high-altitude plateau with sparse grass and rocky outcrops. The terrain can be divided into four parts:**
    1. **Rocky Ground**: Flat, rocky surface with occasional boulders.
    2. **Sparse Grass**: Small patches of grass growing between rocks.
    3. **Rocky Outcrops**: Jagged rock formations rising from the ground.
    4. **Distant Mountains**: Tall, snow-capped peaks on the horizon.
