**The scene depicts a rocky desert with sparse vegetation and a dry riverbed. The terrain can be divided into four parts:**
   1. **Rocky Ground**: Uneven, jagged rocks covering the surface.
   2. **Dry Riverbed**: A flat, sandy area with occasional large rocks.
   3. **Sparse Vegetation**: Small, hardy plants scattered across the landscape.
   4. **Distant Hills**: Low, rocky hills on the horizon.
