**The scene depicts a snowy forest with a frozen stream. The terrain can be divided into four parts:**
   1. **Snow-Covered Ground**: Flat, white snow with occasional footprints.
   2. **Frozen Stream**: A flat, icy surface with cracks and ridges.
   3. **Tree Trunks**: Tall, snow-covered trees with bare branches.
   4. **Snowdrifts**: Piles of snow blown against the trees.
