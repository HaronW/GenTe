**The scene depicts a quiet forest with a small wooden cabin and a dirt path. The terrain can be divided into four parts:**
    1. **Wooden Cabin**: A small, wooden structure with a sloped roof.
    2. **Dirt Path**: A narrow, uneven trail with occasional roots and rocks.
    3. **Tree Trunks**: Tall, thick trees with rough bark.
    4. **Canopy**: A dense layer of leaves and branches overhead.
