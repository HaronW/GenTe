**The scene depicts a vast desert with sand dunes and a small oasis. The terrain can be divided into four parts:**
    1. **Sand Dunes**: Rolling hills of soft, golden sand.
    2. **Oasis**: A small, flat area with water and palm trees.
    3. **Rocky Outcrops**: Jagged rocks scattered across the desert.
    4. **Distant Horizon**: Flat, endless sand stretching to the horizon.
