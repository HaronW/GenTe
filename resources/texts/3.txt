**The scene depicts a sandy beach with waves gently lapping at the shore. The terrain can be divided into four parts:**
   1. **Sandy Shore**: Flat, soft sand with occasional shells and seaweed.
   2. **Water's Edge**: Where the waves meet the sand, creating a wet, reflective surface.
   3. **Dunes**: Small, sandy hills covered with sparse grass.
   4. **Ocean**: A vast, open body of water with gentle waves.
