**The scene depicts a quiet churchyard with a stone church and gravestones. The terrain can be divided into four parts:**
    1. **Stone Church**: A tall, stone building with a steeple.
    2. **Gravestones**: Flat, rectangular markers with inscriptions.
    3. **Grassy Ground**: Flat, green grass covering the churchyard.
    4. **Pathways**: Flat, gravel paths winding through the churchyard.
