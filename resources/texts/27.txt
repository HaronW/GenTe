**The scene depicts a small vineyard with rows of grapevines and a farmhouse. The terrain can be divided into four parts:**
    1. **Grapevines**: Rows of plants with green leaves and grapes.
    2. **Farmhouse**: A small, stone building with a sloped roof.
    3. **Dirt Paths**: Flat, unpaved trails between the rows of vines.
    4. **Surrounding Hills**: Low, green hills on the horizon.
