**The scene depicts a grassy meadow with wildflowers and a small stream. The terrain can be divided into four parts:**
    1. **Grassy Ground**: Flat, green grass with occasional wildflowers.
    2. **Stream**: A narrow, shallow body of water with a gentle current.
    3. **Wildflowers**: Small, colorful flowers scattered across the meadow.
    4. **Distant Trees**: A line of trees on the horizon.
