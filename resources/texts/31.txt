**The scene depicts a small island with a single palm tree and a sandy beach. The terrain can be divided into four parts:**
    1. **Sandy Beach**: Flat, soft sand with occasional shells.
    2. **Palm Tree**: A tall, slender tree with large, green fronds.
    3. **Rocky Outcrop**: A small, jagged rock formation near the water.
    4. **Ocean**: A vast, open body of water with gentle waves.
