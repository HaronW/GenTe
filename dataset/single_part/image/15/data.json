    "scene_description": "The terrain consists of a natural, uneven forest path with scattered tree roots and small inclines. The path is predominantly flat with occasional dips and rises. The surrounding area is covered with a mix of grass and dirt, creating a rough, natural ground. There are several large tree roots protruding from the ground, creating obstacles along the path. The terrain can be divided into four parts: \n\n1. **Flat Ground Terrain**: The majority of the path is relatively flat, suitable for general walking and running.\n2. **Natural Ground Terrain**: The surrounding area is uneven and natural, with variations in height due to the forest floor.\n3. **Discrete Obstacles Terrain**: Tree roots create discrete obstacles along the path, requiring careful navigation.\n4. **Sloped Terrain**: There are small inclines and dips along the path, providing minor elevation changes.\n\nThese parts can be simulated using functions such as `flat_ground_terrain`, `natural_ground_terrain`, `discrete_obstacles_terrain`, and `sloped_terrain`.",
