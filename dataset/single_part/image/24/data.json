    "scene_description": "The scene depicts a forested area with a dirt path winding through it. The terrain is uneven, with a mix of flat and slightly sloped areas. There are patches of grass and fallen leaves scattered around. The path itself has some small rocks and irregularities. The trees are tall and sparse, allowing some sunlight to filter through.\n\n1. **Flat Ground Terrain**: The main path can be modeled as a flat ground terrain, with occasional small rocks and irregularities.\n2. **Natural Ground Terrain**: The surrounding area, including the patches of grass and fallen leaves, can be modeled as natural ground terrain.\n3. **Sloped Terrain**: Some sections of the path and the surrounding ground have slight slopes, which can be modeled using sloped terrain functions.\n4. **Discrete Obstacles Terrain**: The small rocks along the path can be modeled using discrete obstacles terrain functions.\n\nThese elements combined will create a realistic simulation of the forested area for robot training.",
