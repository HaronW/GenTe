    "scene_description": "The image depicts a coastal scene with a dynamic ocean and rocky shore. The terrain can be divided into four parts:\n\n1. **Foreground Rocks**: This section features several large, irregularly shaped rocks partially submerged in the water. The height varies significantly, with some rocks protruding above the water surface.\n\n2. **Shallow Water**: Surrounding the rocks, there is shallow water with gentle waves lapping against the shore. The depth gradually increases moving away from the shore.\n\n3. **Ocean Waves**: Further out, the ocean is characterized by larger, more powerful waves breaking towards the shore. The wave height and frequency increase as you move deeper into the ocean.\n\n4. **Background Horizon**: The horizon shows a calm sea extending to the sky, with no significant elevation changes.\n\nTo generate this terrain using the provided functions, you can:\n\n1. Use `discrete_obstacles_terrain` for the foreground rocks.\n2. Implement `generate_river_terrain` for the shallow water area.\n3. Apply `wave_terrain` for the ocean waves.\n4. Keep the background horizon as a flat ground using `flat_ground_terrain`.",
