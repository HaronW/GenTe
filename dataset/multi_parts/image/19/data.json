    "scene_description": "The image depicts a construction site with a wooden framework for a shed or deck. The terrain can be divided into four parts:\n\n1. **Left Side**: The ground is covered with gravel and dirt, with some wooden beams partially buried. The terrain is relatively flat but uneven.\n2. **Right Side**: The ground is grassy with some dirt patches, and there are wooden beams laid out on the ground. The terrain is slightly elevated compared to the left side.\n3. **Front Side**: The ground is a mix of grass and dirt, with a clear path where the wooden beams are laid out. There is a slight slope from the right to the left.\n4. **Back Side**: The ground is covered with dirt and some grass, with a few wooden beams placed on top. There is a small elevation near the back wall.\n\nThe overall terrain is uneven with variations in height between different sections, suitable for training robots to navigate natural terrains.",
