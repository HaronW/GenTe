    "scene_description": "The image depicts a coastal scene with clear, shallow water near the shore. The terrain can be described as follows:\n\n1. **Shoreline**: The shoreline is a flat, sandy beach with some small rocks and pebbles. This area can be simulated using the `flat_ground_terrain` function.\n\n2. **Shallow Water**: The water near the shore is shallow and clear, gradually deepening as it moves away from the shore. This can be modeled using the `generate_river_terrain` function with a gentle slope.\n\n3. **Deep Water**: Further out, the water becomes deeper and more uniform in depth. This deeper section can be represented using the `flat_ground_terrain` function with a slightly higher elevation than the shallow water.\n\n4. **Waves**: There are small waves breaking near the shore, which can be simulated using the `wave_terrain` function to add dynamic movement to the water surface.\n\nBy dividing the scene into these four parts, each can be generated using appropriate functions to create a realistic coastal environment for training robots.",
