    "scene_description": "The scene depicts a natural outdoor environment with a dirt road leading through it. The terrain can be divided into four main parts:\n\n1. **Dirt Road**: A winding dirt path with varying elevations, creating a natural ground terrain.\n2. **Grassy Area**: Adjacent to the road, there is a grassy area with some unevenness, suitable for a natural ground terrain.\n3. **Hillside**: On one side of the road, there is a gentle slope leading up to a hillside, which can be modeled as a sloped terrain.\n4. **Building Area**: In the background, there are buildings under construction on an elevated platform, which can be represented as a flat ground terrain with discrete obstacles.\n\nThe overall scene requires a combination of natural ground terrains, sloped terrains, and flat ground terrains with discrete obstacles to accurately simulate the environment.",
